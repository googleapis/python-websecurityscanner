The previous alpha release, spelled ``v1alpha`` is provided to continue to support code previously written against it. In order to use it, you will want to import from it e.g., ``google.cloud.websecurityscanner_v1alpha`` in lieu of ``google.cloud.websecurityscanner`` (or the equivalent ``google.cloud.websecurityscanner_v1beta``).
